# anypb

`anypb` helps you interactively generate Protobuf messages, and output them
either in the serialized Protobuf format, or the canonical JSON encoding.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/torkelrogstad/anypb@latest
```

## Usage

`anypb` assumes you're in a [Buf](https://buf.build)
[module](https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v1/buf-yaml/) or
[workspace](https://buf.build/docs/reference/workspaces/).

In the future I might add support for working with non-Buf Protobuf sources.

```bash

```

## Fish-completions

If you're using Fish shell, copy the file `anypb.fish` to
`$HOME/.config/fish/completions/anypb.fish`.
